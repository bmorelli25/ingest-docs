* 16. If you are standardizing on Kafka as middleware message queue 
** 16b.  Using Logstash to read from kafka, and route it to appropriate ES or other destination. 
*** The raw to ECS transformation and any other enrichment is done as recommended in the earlier section. 
*** Agent doesnâ€™t support kafka output today hence the first logstash tier
*** The second Logstash tier is useful for use cases mentioned earlier for data routing to different ES and other destinations and enrichment from outside data sources
